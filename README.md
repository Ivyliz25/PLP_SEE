# Fun Calculator 🎉

Welcome to the **Fun Calculator**! This simple Python program performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two user-provided numbers with a touch of fun and humor. 😎

## Features ✨
- ➕ **Addition**: Adds two numbers
- ➖ **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first
- ✖️ **Multiplication**: Multiplies the two numbers
- ➗ **Division**: Divides the first number by the second (no zero-division checks—handle with care!)

## How to Use 🚀
1. **Run the script** in a Python environment (Python 3.x recommended).
2. **Enter the first number** when prompted.
3. **Enter the second number** when prompted.
4. **View the results** for all four operations printed on the screen.

## Example Output 📊
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 2
Results of your two numbers:
Sum: 12.0
Difference: 8.0
Product: 20.0
Quotient: 5.0
```

## Notes ⚠️
- The program uses `float()` to handle decimal inputs.
- **Division by zero** will crash the program—this is a "fun" calculator, not a "safe" one! 😅

## Future Improvements 🔮
- Add error handling for division by zero.
- Include more operations (e.g., exponentiation, modulus).
- Add a loop to perform multiple calculations without restarting.

Enjoy calculating like a boss! 💻🎉
